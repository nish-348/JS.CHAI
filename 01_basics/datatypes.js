//refference types ke andar jo value store hoti hai wo memory me kisi alag jagah store hoti hai, aur variable ke andar us jagah ka address store hota hai

//Primitive DataTypes:


//1.Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Example: 5, 3.14.
 
//2.String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Example: "Hello, world!".

//3,Boolean: Represents a binary value, either true or false, often used for conditional logic.

//4.Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet. Example: let x;.

//5.Null:  standalone value it is represenataion of empty value it is special type and it is a object type. Example: let y = null; 

//6.Symbol (ES6): it is mostly used used to find uniqnece.

//7.BigInt (ES11): Represents large integers that cannot be represented by the Number type.

 //Refence (Object Data Types):

//1.Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs (properties and methods). Example: { name: "John", age: 30 }.

//2.Array: Represents a list-like collection of values, indexed by numbers (integer indices). Example: [1, 2, 3, 4].

//3.Function: Represents a reusable block of code that can be invoked or called with arguments. Example: function add(x, y) { return x + y; }.

//4.Date: Represents dates and times.

//5.RegExp: Represents regular expressions for pattern matching.

//lets talk about some Range of Primitive DataType:

  //  1.Number:
    //    Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
      //  Typical Range: -9,007,199,254,740,992 (-2^53) to 9,007,199,254,740,992 (2^53) inclusive.
        //Smallest Increment: 2^(-52).

   // 2.String:
      //  Represents a sequence of characters.
        //No specific range limit, but practical limits depend on memory and system resources.

    //3.Boolean:
      //  Represents true or false.
        //Only two possible values: true and false.

    //4.Undefined:
      //  Represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value.
        //It has only one possible value: undefined.

   // 5.Null:
     //   Represents the intentional absence of any object or value.
       // It has only one possible value: null.

    //6.Symbol (ES6):
      //  Represents a unique and immutable value.
        //No specific range limit.

    //7.BigInt (ES11):
      //  Represents large integers that cannot be represented by the Number type.
        //The range is practically unlimited and depends on available memory.
